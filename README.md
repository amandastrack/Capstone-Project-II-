# Music Recommendation System | Capstone Project II
## Amanda Strack


Recommendation systems are vitals features for companies such as Amazon, Netflix and Google. The underlying goal of the recommendation system is to personalize content and to present the most relevant items to the companyâ€™s audience. This creates a better user experience while also driving incremental revenue.In this project I will build a recommendation system for users to discover new music. 

For my recommendation system I will use a combination of collaborative filtering and classification.The approach will begin with matrix factorization of the user listen count data.Then the latent factors found will join the spotify audio data as additional features. Finally, classification will be performed to provide the final song recommendation.
